            <h2>About Me:</h2>
            <p>I am currently a student at the University of Massachusetts,
            Lowell campus completing my <em>Bachelor's Degree in Computer
            Science</em>. My expected completion is in August of 2020. My
            passion in Computer Science is directed at software development,
            and my dream job is to be in the Software Engineer position of a
            great company. I enjoy programming solutions to problems and
            watching my code execute as designed for the user.</p>
            <!--Inspiration-->
            <p>I am from southern New Hampshire and have been interested in how
            computers work since I was young. In the early 2000's, I was
            given a Compaq Presario PC with a 512MB HDD. With this machine,
            I used to explore the (OS and BIOS) settings and hardware
            components to further understand computers.</p>
