Currently working:

-Dragging and dropping to squares on the board.
-Tiles exist as an array read from a JSON file
-Able to draw 7 unique randomly chosen tiles, with the number-remaining decrementing in the json object
-Structure for dragging and dropping. 2-d array structure of ID names of elements
-Bounce back when invalid location
-over 530 lines of code

Bugs:
-Tiles don't snap back to the bar, but the last object it was dropped onto (the board)
-Cannot submit words :(
-Couldn't get the divs on the board to "absorb" the object
-Elements get misplaced during resizing
-no functionality for blank tiles
-tiles don't reset on new game

I submitted late in order to try to get extra credit done. But after many hours,
I do not have enough time to fully create my game.

I was aiming to create a full playable game, with a nice UI.
